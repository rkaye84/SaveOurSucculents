              <h2 class="card-title">English Ivy</h2>
              <p class="card-text">However stunning the English Ivy can be, like any traditional Englishman, it's rather particular.
                <p><b>Light:</b> This guy requires plenty light. However, be careful not to leave somewhere that may get excessively hot, as overheating will lead to discolouration and drying. Too cold however, it will turn a purple hue.</p>
                <p><b>Water:</b> This ivy likes an evenly moist environment, and needs to be watered freely. Particularly during winter, they will need a little extra to avoid drying out. The best way to maintain is to spray with soft water weekly. If you're an avidly invested plant carer, you may want to dilute this with a quarter of fertiliser to improve performance.</p>
                <p><b>Environment:</b> Your plant will need to be in soil, for optimum water retention and drainage. They can regularly be affected by pests, including spider mites, aphids, mealybugs and scale insects. Red spider mites are often difficult to see without a close inspection. However, white webs formed on the plant are usually indicative of a spider mite infestation. To save the rest of the plant, remove the infested leaves and treat the plant with a pesticide or insecticidal soap.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Fiddle Leaf Fig</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Remember the roots with this one– as in origin. Fiddle leaf figs come from jungle environments: dark, dense, warm and wet, an with thrive best somewhere this is replicated.
                <p><b>Light:</b>This plant needs quite an average level of light – shouldn’t be in direct sunlight though not in the darkness so save the south facing windows for your succulents! Signs of incorrect light exposure include flagging foliage and pale, spotty, or wan-looking leaves – something to look out for when buying also, as non-reputable sources rarely invest as much effort into care as I'm certain you houseplanting experts here on the difficult page will!</p>
                <p><b>Water:</b>To replicate the water level, think rainfall. The soil should be consistently damp, never soaking. To avoid overwatering, use this little trick from Chris Raimondi, president of the Raimondi Horticultural Group: to water properly, wait until the top inch of soil is dry. Then, thoroughly drench until water comes out the bottom of the pot and leave it to slowly dry out again. Signs of underwatering include limp, floppy leaves and foliage yellowing, browning then dropping off.</p>
                <p><b>Environment:</b>Careful with the food – not much of an appetite so fertilise only once or twice a year. Also watch out for this temperature – a Fiddle Leaf Fig's at home in a hot jungle environment and will be fine at a normal, homely temperature though will falter quickly when exposed to the cold. Avoid placing in a draft eg. from a door or window.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Orchid</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Orchids are stunning home feature, but as is often the case in life, the better something appears, the more you have to work for it.
                <p><b>Light:</b>A perfect balanced is require here, direct sunlight may cause plants to burn, and too little light will prevent plants from flowering. An ideal location is behind curtains or window blinds.</p>
                <p><b>Water:</b>Orchids require ample water, but should certainly be left to dry out between waterings. To avoid overwatering, press a finger into the soil to test how damp it is. If it’s dry, give it some water, if not let it be – it’s happy!</p>
                <p><b>Enviornment:</b>Indoor orchids are fans of humid environments, which you can create by either placing a tray of water or pebbles below the orchid, misting daily – or alternatively investing in a humidifier. While producing new growth, your hungry orchid will need fertilising once to twice weekly. This need lessens as they mature, to only monthly, then once they become dormant you should stop altogether. Also keep an eye out for signs of pests or disease. Orchids are occasionally affected by mealybugs, scale, and aphids, which  can usually be washed off or treated with insecticidal soap.</p>
                <p><b>Repotting:</b>If your orchid starts looking a bit unhappy, and stops blooming, replotting may be necessary. This should be done every other year anyway, as orchids can outgrow their homes or the soil may become crumbly. To replot, pick a slightly larger pot, put your orchid potting mix into a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Drain once it reaches room temperature. They are very sensitive when it comes to bacteria and germs. Make a solution of ½ cup of household bleach and 1 gallon of water. Soak all your tools in this and wash your hands before proceeding. Gently pull the pot away from the plant and wash off the roots. Use sharp scissors to cut off any brown or rotting roots. Fill the new planter with the soaked potting medium and place the plant so that the base is right at the top of the medium. Use a chopstick to help push bits of planting medium in between the roots. Keep the orchid misted for at least a week until the new roots begin to appear.</p>
