            <h3>The ZZ Plant</h3>
            <p class="card-text">The ZZ plant is a very low maintenance plant. Due to its waxy over-coat this fun plant often gets mistaken for being plastic. When caring for the ZZ plant, only water it when the soil is fully dry; if over-watered,
              it can turn yellow. It does best in bright to moderate indirect light but will do fine in extreme low levels of light.
              Needing very little water or light, this is the perfect plant for a student.
