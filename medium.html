                <p class="card-text">Grown indoors, the trails of rosary vine can reach a hearty two metres! </p>
                <p class="card-text">light: indoors you want to give it very bight light with no direct sun, a west facing window is ideal! </p>
                <p class="card-text">Water: water every 3-5 days to ensure optimal root moisture, watering even less in winter. </p>
                <p class="card-text">Repotting: this is where is where the challenge sets in. An equal blend of succulent and cactus mix and coco coir would make your String Of Hearts very happy. It's essential to make sure the mix drains really well so the tubers don't rot out.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Monstera Delicisosa.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Nicknamed the Swiss cheese plant, native to the jungles of Southern Mexico and Guatemala this leafy guy is sure to give your living space those funky jungle vibes you've been looking for! </p>
                <p class="card-text">Light: keep this plant in a warm climate away from direct sunlight</p>
                <p class="card-text">Water: let the top 4cm of soil dry out between watering as over watering may lead to root rot. If your Monstera produces aerial roots, manoeuvre them towards some water. </p>
                <p class="card-text">Repotting: congratulations, you've managed not to kill your monstera and it now needs a bigger pot. Worry not! Repotting the old cheese plant is easy; a mix comprised of equal parts potting mixture and sphagnum moss will do the job ... but note when planted in containers they will require monthly feeding in spring and summer.</p>
                <p class="card-text">n.b. clean the leaves of this cheesy boi to ensure it remains pest-free! </p>

                <p class="card-text">Light: grow indoors with bright indirect sunlight, although it will also tolerate low-light condition. If the leaves become pale, this is a sign of too much sun.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Water: this plant likes to have the soil dry out between watering so will accept erratic watering care, so you can leave watering to when the leaves start to wilt slightly.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Repotting: if the roots have consumed the pot, repot it in a new container a container one size larger than what you are taking it out of and add fresh potting soil. </p>
